Scapecraft
==========

Scapecraft is a modification for the game minecraft, you will require the forge api to edit and work with this source code. This mod adds new blocks, items, entities, bosses, skills and more!

This is the first draft of code wrote with the support of online tutorials, and as such documentation and coding is relatively poor, if you are looking to revive this version for 1.6.4 minecraft please contact me at scapecraftserver@gmail.com with any queries. 
"potato" is where the client and common proxies are stored, it is bad name I know and many such poor coding practises are in this code, it was uploaded after common request and community collaboration rather than built as an example project. 

Check out our subreddit for the project for up to date news.
